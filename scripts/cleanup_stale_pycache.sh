# tracked by git, so a .py file deleted upstream leaves its compiled
# bytecode sitting on disk indefinitely. Same for compose/state/.pids and
# compose/state/logs entries for a service whose script no longer exists.
# Harmless on its own, but confusing when investigating "is this still
# running" (a stale .pid/.log can look like evidence of a live process).

# Remove __pycache__ entries for every .py file a commit range deleted.
