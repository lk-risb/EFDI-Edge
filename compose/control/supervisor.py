"""supervisor.py — restart bridges, protocols and layers that died on their own.

Watches the host-managed services and brings back the ones that crashed. It
deliberately does NOT re-run anything that was stopped on purpose, so it can be
left running alongside stop.sh and the admin web UI without fighting either.

The distinction it keys off already exists in admin_control._service_status():

  crashed  pidfile present, process gone   -> the service died; restart it
  stopped  no pidfile                      -> stop.sh / the UI removed it; leave it
  running  pidfile present, process alive  -> nothing to do

stop.sh deletes the pidfile as part of stopping, which is what makes a clean
stop indistinguishable from "never started" and distinguishable from a crash.
Restarting on "stopped" would mean a `./stop.sh all` immediately came back up.
Use --start-stopped only for a boot-time sweep, where that is the intent.

Only bridges, protocols and layers are supervised. Infrastructure (the Zenoh
router and the control agent itself) is excluded: restarting the agent from
underneath the web UI would drop the connection the request arrived on.

Run:
    venv/bin/python3 compose/control/supervisor.py                  # crash recovery, every 15s
    venv/bin/python3 compose/control/supervisor.py --once           # single pass, for cron
    venv/bin/python3 compose/control/supervisor.py --start-stopped   # also start selected-but-down
    venv/bin/python3 compose/control/supervisor.py --dry-run -v      # report, change nothing
